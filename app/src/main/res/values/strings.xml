    <string name="text_content">Another year, another update to the world’s most popular mobile operating system — and this year,
        that means Android 11. But what could Google possibly add to a platform that’s been kicking for more than a decade,
        that seemingly already contains every feature under the sun? That’s where Android 11 comes in.
        As we’ve come to expect from Android updates in recent years,
        version 11 opts for smaller changes rather than transformative ones,
        that make navigating Google’s OS a bit more intuitive and convenient.
        Redesigned screenshots and media playback controls,
        a new way to message friends and useful tweaks to app permissions may not be earth-shattering additions,
        but they’re nonetheless appreciated.</string>
